## Go package structure

## Concurrency and review

If a developer implements something related to concurrency (e.g., using goroutines or the sync package), a code review must be conducted by AI, too (e.g., ChatGPT). An [example](https://github.com/voedger/kb/issues/57).

## testdata folder

`testdata` folder: name is special for the Go toolchain, which will ignore files in it (so you can place files named *.go there, for example, and they won't be built or analyzed)

## Avoid using .cmd files

Do not use `.cmd` files, use `.sh` or `.bash` even on Windows.

## Black-box testing

Test files shall be in the `<testing-package>_test` package, whenever posisble (black-box testing).

## Testable Examples in Go

If possible create testable examples for your code. They are a great way to document your code and provide examples of how to use it.
